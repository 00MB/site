        <h1>How To Learn - May 2021</h1><b>
            <p>I have recently been thinking about how and why people learn, and have discovered 2 main systems for learning. One is far better than the other.</p>
        </b>
        <h2>Learning through fear</h2>
        <p>A lot of my friends seem to learn through fear. What do I mean by this? Learning through fear is usually when you are feeling forced to learn something, with some external pressure. Common phrases like “My parents want me to be X” or “doing X will make me successful” are some key signs. Usually these students are tied to long, depressing schedules of studying with little choice. Most likely, there is a threat connected to this method as well, such as punishments if X grade is not achieved. This creates a completely toxic mindset, leading students to suicide [1]. Edge cases of this approach are prominent in asian countries like South Korea. Take the Suneung (South Korean CSAT) for example, a crazy final example that kids spend years endlessly studying for. One wrong answer can dictate getting into university, and getting into university is crucial for most South Korean students. Some are even threatened with disownment. To note, South Korea also has one of the highest suicide rates for students. [2]</p>

        <p>So learning through fear sounds terrible, what about the alternative?
        </p>
        <h2>Learning through passion</h2>
        <p>
            Learning through passion is different, more enjoyable. This style of learning has little bias from external factors. You are learning what makes you curious, not what makes you the most money, makes your family the happiest etc. I was first introduced to learning through passion at Hestia Academy [3], where everyone was curious and actively learning what they wanted, when they wanted. Then they were applying this learning to create crazy, new projects that have never been made before! Learning through passion does not have time limits, threats, strict guidelines etc. In fact it is basically the opposite. Failure is rewarded, and tight rules around when and what you do are scrapped. The problem with this style of learning is it first requires you to find your passions, which I will talk about in the future.
<br /><br />
These learning systems become interesting when you compare the outcomes. Unfortunately, learning through fear actually creates “success” (success being completely ambiguous). But is success really tied to results? What point is being “successful” at the cost of having a terrible mental health, depleting yourself of happiness. In my opinion, nobody in this condition can be considered successful. Even regardless of damage to mental health, the richest, smartest and coolest people in world learn through passion, as it the only true way to learn.

        <h3>Notes: </h3>
        <ul>
            <li>* “doing X will make me successful” - this is a blurry one but the true passion is being successful, not learning.</li>
        </ul>
