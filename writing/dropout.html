        <h2>Dropping Out - March 2022</h2>
        <b>
            <p>I dropped out a couple weeks ago, this was my thought process.</p>
        </b>
        <p>
            I recently took an interruption of study for my Computer Science course at The University of Edinburgh. I can return in august, although this is essentially me dropping out. I will answer 3 questions: why I made the decision, how I made the decision and what I hope to do with the free time.
        </p>
        <h2>Why?</h2>
        <p>
            Why did I make the decision? It was simply acting as a ceiling on my success. I felt like university work was taking up a large amount of my time. Although, it was not the work itself, but the procrastination. I hated the thought of having to do boring work that I did not enjoy. That being said the work was also useless. I do not care about making Sudoku solvers and simple text based games. I would spend my free time making useful projects with real world use. Things that could actually help other people. This is what I enjoyed doing, not the former.
        </p>
        <p>
            I also hated the environment. Most people in my university did not care about changing the world, doing cool shit that changes the way we think and do things. Instead, money seemed to be the big motivator. FAANG was glorified as the pinnacle of success. The people I knew at university were pretty smart, but it was hard to find someone that was both smart and ambitious about solving real problems (I will talk about this in another post).
        </p>
        <h2>How?</h2>
        <p>What made me take the decision? I had been looking for a way out of the main route: University, FAANG etc. More and more I was putting less time into university, and more time into my other, more enjoyable projects like hackathons and streaming. I also have time to explore other topics like history and economics. I remember watching an economics lecture about indifference curves, and decided to make one for university. I thought about what I actually valued from university, funding (ie scholarships) and meeting new people. I then plotted university, a software job and becoming a founder. I quickly realised that university looked like a terrible path compared to the others. I then thought about how much I valued a degree, time wise. I put it at about 6 months. The fact that I was going to spend 4 years made my decision pretty clear. I also recently got into web3 and saw the potential it had. This finalised my decision, I was going to drop out.</p>
        <h2>What now?</h2>
        <p>What am I going to do with my newfound free time? Firstly, I plan to read a lot, covering the subjects I did not have to do before. Biology, Economics, History, Law etc. I also look to go deeper into my projects and hobbies. Learning Rust, streaming more, spending more time talking to other likeminded people that also want to change the world. Finally, I will look to find a software position in web3. My roadmap is lot more foggy than the main path, but there could be mountains above the clouds. I just need to maximise the chance of discovering them.
