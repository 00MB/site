        <h1>Threats and the idea of a social contract.</h1><b>
            <p>2 great ways to create a habit is through adding a consequence for failing to finish a task (threat) and connecting the task with other people (social contract).</p>
        </b><br />
        <h2>The Problem</h2>
        <p>A goal among most people is to wake up earlier. This makes sense right. Why would you not want to maximise the number of hours in your day? Sure, some argue that we live in a "sleep-deprived society", but I am not here to talk about the science of sleep, I am here to talk about habits. I definitely need to wake up earlier and if you are reading this then chances are you do too, so I will use this as an example.</p>
        <p>. All you really need to know is that they are not easy to create. Waking up early one day is not hard, waking up early every day for a year is. But how can make habit creation easier?</p><br />
        <h2>Creating a Threat</h2>
        <p>Think about a task that you do not enjoy doing. A good example of this could be homework - most students do not enjoy completing homework, but most of the time they do it anyway. Imagine if that homework was optional. You would probably not complete it. This may seem like common sense, but this is a clear example of adding a threat. The threat in this example is failing the test, the school contacting your parents, or whatever the consequence from not submitting the homework is. This seems to be the one factor between not doing a task and successfully completing it.</p>
        <p>Some problems arise though. This threat needs to be a hard barrier, something that is completely cheat-proof. Your brain works by trying to find the quickest way to deal with this threat. Usually, the quickest way is by cheating. Let's go back to the homework example. The quickest way to complete your homework is usually to cheat and use someone else's work. This is how cheating works, if it was easier to do the homework yourself you would choose to do so. Your brain chooses the easiest option, in this case, the easiest option is to cheat. How do we solve this though? How do we create a hard barrier? One solution is what is called a social contract.</p><br />
        <h2>The Social Contract</h2>
        <p>To put it simply, a social/habit contract is a connection created between your task and an outside party (usually a friend). James Clear explains this well: "A habit contract is a verbal or written agreement in which you state your commitment to a particular habit and the punishment that will occur if you donâ€™t follow through. Then you find one or two people to act as your accountability partners and sign off on the contract with you". A good example of this in use is live streamers. Although not intentionally, live streamers have a social contract with their viewers that they will go live at a certain time. The viewers hold them accountable, they are expecting that the streamer goes live and if they do not, they are less likely to stay and watch. Without this idea, I could not imagine streamers would be very consistent.</p><br />
        <h2>Putting These Ideas in Action</h2>
        <p>As I said, I am terrible at waking up. How can I solve this using the ideas just discussed? One idea came to mind. Can I make a script that checks if I am on my computer during certain hours of the night? This sounds like a good idea, but I could not think of a way for a server to check my computer is on without using computational power on my own computer. So I thought, what do I do on my computer during the night? One thing I do is talk to people on Discord. I could make a discord bot that makes sure I am not online at certain hours of the night and makes sure I come online during a 15-minute window at 5am. This is the social contract, but what about the threat?</p>
