        <h2>The Addiction Algorithm - June 2021</h2><b>
            <p>Addiction can be viewed as a decision tree, with the probability of saying yes exponentially increasing. Reversing this habit means climbing the length of the tree.</p>
        </b>
        <p>Nearly everyone has been addicted to something. In fact, most people in society are addicted to their phones right now. Everyone knows of addiction and some common ways to solve it, but few actually understand it. Below, I will display my idea of addiction through logic, then recommend some proven solutions. Throughout this essay, I will use drugs as an example, as it is a clear and general example. By addiction, I am also only referring to addiction with a negative effect.</p><br />
        <h2>Understanding Addiction</h2>
        <p>Addiction can be boiled down to a tree of decisions - let me explain. Before you indulge in any addictive activity, there is always a decision that is made before it - this decision is sometimes subconscious. Should I do the activity or not. In this context, it would be "should I take drugs or not?".</p><br /><img src='https://i.ibb.co/71CTccZ/Blank-diagram-2.png' />
        <p>Your very first decision would probably look something like this. As someone who has never taken drugs, if someone came up to me and asked me if I wanted to, I would, well, most likely say no right? This can be reflected by the probability heavily in favour of not taking drugs. You might be thinking, "Okay, but obviously you would not accept drugs at random from a stranger". Of course, there are many factors affecting this probability, it heavily varies by context. Although to keep it simple I will not account for any uncertainty. If you want to picture it that way, add a Â±U to every probability. This uncertainty is probably a lot larger than you think.</p>
        <p>So I have made my decision, I will not take drugs! During the moment that outcome only affects our state, but something much more long term has also been affected, our probabilities (note: If you are familiar with machine learning concepts you might see a resemblance to the weights and biases idea). These probabilities have been ever so slightly adjusted so that the next time this decision occurs, they will be different. These changes are not constant but are determined by these probabilities. For example, if I don't take drugs, it is a common decision that will only add a little change to the probability, let's say 0.1%. Now on the rare occasion, I do take drugs, the probability would increase by a much larger number, let's say 5%. This creates an exponential graph like so.</p><br /><img src='https://i.ibb.co/HC65WPg/Drawing-sketchpad-1.png' />
        <p>Okay, so our probabilities have been updated, now what? Well, most likely this will not be the last time you come across this decision (note: chance of decisions also increases with addiction). You will be making this decision, monthly, weekly even daily if it becomes a habit, so much so that you begin to form a tree of decisions, with your decisions taking one path of many. Addiction is a journey, you do not become an "addict" after taking drugs once, but after many minor probability changes (maybe drugs is a bad example for this).</p><br /><img src='https://i.ibb.co/3mpLcnM/Blank-diagram-3.png' />
        <p>Now, we can reshape this journey in another view, this time displaying probability rates as depth, with the bottom being a 99% probability favouring drugs during the decision (note: 0% and 100% are asymptotes, they cannot be reached). You can think of this as rock bottom, you do not want to be here. This also works the other way, you want to be at the top, in control of your decisions.</p><br /><img src='https://i.ibb.co/YLtQnbN/Blank-diagram-Page-2.png' />
        <p>Okay, but how do we stay in the top zone, how do we not get dragged down to the bottom, and how do we climb back up?</p><br />
        <h2>Solutions</h2><b>
            <p>Solution 1 - cutting addiction at the root</p>
        </b>
        <p>Everyone knows the best way to deal with an addiction is to not have one in the first place. Even after choosing the addictive outcome a couple of times, it is much easier to kill this addiction than being a hard addict for many years. Common sense. The depth of your path along with the length is a good indicator of how hard the process of eliminating the addiction will be. Your path length is a lot shorter if you have only made the decision a couple of times (a couple of nodes long to be exact).</p><b>
            <p>Solution 2 - limiting the number of decisions</p>
        </b>
        <p>From viewing the decision tree, it might seem like the only way to move up (become less addicted) is to say no to these decisions. Although saying no is helping to reinforce the rejection in your brain, the probability changes are mainly affected by the outcome. As time passes without indulging, you will feel less addicted. Sure, not in the short term, but you have probably experienced this as well. A common example is gaming consoles. Usually, there comes a time where you stop playing video games, sure you miss it for the first week, but after years of not making the decision to play, you lose the urge, the addiction. As time passes without decisions, the probability is very slightly altered. Over many months and years, this compounds and helps end addiction.</p><b>
            <p>Solution 3 - creating the best uncertainty during the decision</p>
        </b>
        <p>If you say no to drugs you will not be addicted, simple right? Trying to do that as an addict is extremely hard (I would not know but assume). I wrote earlier about the idea of context, the uncertainty that makes every situation slightly different. Imagine being peer pressured into drugs alone vs having a friend next to you persuading you not to. The uncertainty difference is huge, which will have an effect on the decision outcome. By managing to repeatedly make the right decision, you will start to slowly end the addiction and climb back to the top. Context is very important.</p><br />
        <h2>Putting this idea in action</h2>
        <p>Using the example of drugs, rehabilitation programs make use of solutions 2 and 3 very well. By limiting the number of encounters with drugs and keeping in direct contact with the patients, they are able to minimise the number of decisions being made optimise the decision uncertainty in their favour. But hopefully, if you are reading this you are not addicted to drugs. There are not enough rehab programs for commonly accepted addictions such as phone and shopping addictions. So what other methods work?</p><b>
            <p>Identifying a future addiction</p>
        </b>
        <p>A good way to use the first solution is to identify and try to predict if the activity will lead to addiction. I think most things can become an addiction, for better or for worse. Some will be harder to predict than others but usually, you can use common sense to help filter. A good question to ask is, "has anything similar to this caused an addiction?". If you were addicted to Playstation chances are you would be easily addicted to Xbox. Another good rule of thumb is that if the activity or "thing" has programs or measures created to solving an addiction to it, you should probably stay clear. An example of this is smoking. Smoking has many programs and products available to cure nicotine addictions, this is never a good sign. Not having the addiction in the first place is always the easiest way to solving it.</p><b>
            <p>Changing your environment</p>
        </b>
        <p>This might also seem like common sense, but one way I solved my addictions was by changing my environment. This may include things such as physically changing your room layout and removing or making it much harder to access things that create these addiction decisions. An example of this could be putting your phone/gaming console in a cupboard away. Due to it being out of reach, you make fewer decisions about using it, as it is not as accessible to you. Also, whenever you do have a decision, the uncertainty is also affected as you have to physically get up and plug the console in, much harder now. "Atomic Habits" by James Clear talks about this in more detail, a good read. I take these environmental changes to the extreme, I call it creating "hard borders". Things such as selling my phone and buying a Nokia brick to deal with phone addiction, I recommend it if you really struggle with addiction.</p><b>
            <p>Streaking and other methods</p>
        </b>
        <p>Finally, some other ideas include methods such as streaking, milestones and identity. Streaking helps by creating a habit of not indulging in addictive habits (this works for various reasons I will not get into). Fighting habit with another habit, you could think of it like an anti-habit. An example of this could be creating a streak chart and noting down every day you do not play video games. You might find that when you get to a large streak, there becomes a force in your mind acting against choosing to play the game the next time you get the decision - "if I play the game I will lose my streak". I personally use streaks for all habit creation, not just anti-addiction ones.</p>
        <p>Milestones tie closely to streaks. Tracking and aiming towards milestones helps create a goal to work towards. Rehabilitation centres use this, by giving out awards for 1 month, 1 year without drugs etc. Finally, we have your identity. By simply changing your identity to what you want to achieve, you help reinforce the trait in your brain. For example, if you are trying to not take drugs, you would tell people you do not take drugs, not that you sometimes take drugs. Some may argue that this is lying to yourself and have doubt around this, but it worked for me, which is why I kept it in here (it also has some grounds).</p>
        <p>Addiction can be viewed in many ways, I like to think of it through logic and decision. What we know however is that it plays a big factor in success, whatever you define success as (unless you define it as having an addiction (:). It is a big barrier that many people find hard to cross. Look at it this way, how many successful people have major negative addictions? Maybe it is what's stopping you from being successful. After all, it comes down to the decision of how to spend your time. Addiction is one of many weights that influence this decision. Remove this weight or apply it to the other side and you might just tip the scales.</p>

        <p>A very simple algorithm for this idea would look something like this:</p>
        <p>I understand there are a lot of assumptions and exceptions, addiction is not a simple concept. I try to keep my writing very simple and in doing so I have to strip out a lot of the more complex ideas.
